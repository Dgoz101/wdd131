      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>Here at Crazy Cats we believe that every human alive on this planet should have the option to own a cat that can meet their needs, 
        and most people need companionship and cuddles from their furry friend.</p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>We allow people to apply to adopt cats that others put up for adoption online! We carefully chack each potential listing of a cat to 
        make sure that it is real and not a scam.</p>

        <h2>Care</h2>
        <div class="care-content">
          <div class="care-text">
            <p>We require that all cats are checked by an approved vet before they are shipped to the adopter to make sure that the feline friend is healthy when they arrive. A copy of their medical/vaccine records and other important information will be emailed to you as well as sent with the cat. When they arrive: If you need information on how to care for your cat, you've also come to the right place. While caring for your cat can differ from breed to breed, there are some general things that apply to almost all cats! You will want to groom your cat regularly. Grooming your cat will help reduce hair around the house as well as help you notice any concerning bumps on your cat's skin. Also make sure to give your cat fresh water daily. This one is a bit obvious, but is still very important and can be easily forgotten. For litter boxes, keep them clean and sanitary. It is also recommended you have one litter box per floor. Make sure to have a few toys that your cat enjoys playing with as well, especially when they are young. The best toys are the ones that you can make seem alive, cats love to stalk their prey. If you don't want your cat to scratch up your house, make sure to get it a big enough scratching board. You want your cat to be able to fully be able to stretch out when using the board. Make sure you also take your cat into the vet regularly for check-ups. Cats, especially ones that go outside, can get themselves into some trouble and get infected with a variety of things. Most importantly, just be a smart and good owner!</p>
