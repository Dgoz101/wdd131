			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of my webiste is to make it easier for cats to be adopted online. It will work to allow users to submit a cat for adoption
                and to submit to adopt a cat from the site.
            </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My target audience will be all ages and financial situations. Mainly I will try to target those who want to adopt Cats
                or put up cats for adoption. 
            </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The dynamic elements that I want to add are a form for accepting user input for adoption or putting a cat for adoption.
                The other element I want to add is dynamic buttons/links where they change color when hovered over.
                I also would like to try and add a sorting/filtering process for characteristics of cats.
            </p>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: Agu Display
				I chose this font because it is fun to look and but still readable. I think it also looks good with the colors.
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Roboto
				Easy to read and understand. Very accesible and classy. 
			</h4>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>

			<p>Mission statement: 
                Here at Crazy Cats we believe that every human alive on this planet should have the option to own a cat that can meet their needs, 
                and most people need companionship and cuddles from their furry friend.
                What We Do:
                We allow people to apply to adopt cats that others put up for adoption online! We carefully chack each potential listing of a cat
                to make sure that it is real and not a scam.
                Care: 
                We require that all cats are checked by an approved vet before they are shipped to the adopter to make sure that the feline friend
                is healthy when they arrive. A copy of their medical/vaccine records and other important information will be emailed to you as well
                sent with the cat.
                When they arrive:
                If you need information on how to care for your cat, you’ve also come to the right place. While caring for your cat can differ
                from breed to breed, there are some general things that apply to almost all cats! You will want to groom your cat regularly.
                Grooming your cat will help reduce hair around the house as well as help you notice any concerning bumps on your cat's skin. 
                Also make sure to give your cat fresh water daily. This one is a bit obvious, but is still very important and can be easily
                forgotten. For litter boxes, keep them clean and sanitary. It is also recommended you have one litter box per floor. 
                Make sure to have a few toys that your cat enjoys playing with as well, especially when they are young. The best toys are 
                the ones that you can make seem alive, cats love to stalk their prey. If you don’t want your cat to scratch up your house, 
                make sure to get it a big enough scratching board. You want your cat to be able to fully be able to stretch out when using 
                the board. Make sure you also take your cat into the vet regularly for check-ups. Cats, especially ones that go outside, can 
                get themselves into some trouble and get infected with a variety of things. Most importantly, just be a smart and good owner!
